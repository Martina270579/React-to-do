## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Testing**:
  - Frontend: Jest
  - Backend: Supertest
  - Load Testing: k6
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus
- **Logging**: Winston
- **User Notifications**: React-Toastify

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies for the backend:
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm start
   ```

5. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Testing

To run the tests for the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and execute:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

For the backend, use:
```bash
cd api
npm test
```

### Load Testing

To perform load testing, you can use k6. Follow these steps to run the load tests:

1. Install k6 (if not already installed):
   

2. Navigate to the k6 scripts directory and run the test:
   ```bash
   cd api
   k6 run load_test.js
   ```

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- UI with Toastify notifications
- Monitoring with Prometheus for performance metrics
- Load testing with k6 to simulate multiple users

## Monitoring

The application includes integration with Prometheus for monitoring performance metrics such as:

- API request counts
- Response times
- CPU and memory usage

You can access the metrics by navigating to `http://localhost:5000/metrics` once the backend server is running.
